# Instructions 

## Purpose

main.py provides several classifiers to train on the data.  
The digits dataset, is built in from scikit.
The time series dataset, simplifiedhuraus.csv is the training dataset from:
https://www.kaggle.com/mboaglio/simplifiedhuarus/home
and describes human activity based on cell phone data. 

## CLI Instructions

Many errors will pop up because I have left the classifiers under the default
setting.  The very last frame will be the results of the classifiers running.

## Running the digits data set

python3 main.py -L

## Running the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

python3 -W errors main.py -f simplifiedhuarus.csv -s 2 -e 565 -t 1
